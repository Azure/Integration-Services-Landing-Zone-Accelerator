# Enterprise-Scale-Integration-Services

This is a repository ([aka.ms/EnterpriseScale-Integration-Services](https://aka.ms/EnterpriseScale-Integration-Services)) that contains both enterprise architecture (proven recommendations and considerations) and reference implementaion (deployable artifacts for a common implementations).

## Enterprise-Scale Architecture
Note: Today this points to API Management, and we will soon be updating guidance to include additional services that are part of Microsoft's Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) portfolio.

The enterprise architecture is broken down into six different design areas, where you can find the links to each at:
| Design Area|Considerations|Recommendations|
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Identity and Access Management|[Design Considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/api-management/identity-and-access-management#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/api-management/identity-and-access-management#design-recommendations)|
