# Introduction to Azure Integration Services Cloud Adoption Framework

This article series outlines the process for establishing an Azure
Integration Services platform into your organizationâ€™s cloud adoption
efforts.

## Executive summary of Azure Integration Services

These articles describe how Azure Integration Services workloads impact
your overall strategy, cloud adoption plan, and environmental readiness
efforts, with detailed guidance on common drift for each effort. This
document highlights important best practices to adopt when provisioning
Azure Integration Services and also provides automation that allows you
to provision Azure Integration Services based upon the best practices
that we outline in this document. To support your cloud adoption needs,
the series also outlines considerations and best practices for managing
governance and operations throughout an Azure Integration Services
implementation.

Azure Integration Services (AIS) is the collective name given to a suite
of related, but separate, resource offerings within Azure, which enable
you to build effective integration solutions.

Those resources include:

- API Management

- Data Factory

- Event Grid

- Event Hubs

- Function Apps

- Logic Apps

- Service Bus

- Storage Accounts

To accelerate these efforts, the articles also include detailed
technical resources that describe how to build an enterprise-scale
landing zone that can support your mission-critical Azure Integration
Services needs.

The enterprise architecture is broken down into six different design areas. You can find the links to each here:
